PHP Login and Registration

1) Change the database setting in connection.php to your specific MySQL setting

2) Import sqldump.sql (copy and paste the queries from the file to MySQL Workbench or other similar tool)

3) Make sure you have a database schema called test_users (you may need to right click on MySQL Workbench and click on 'Refresh All')

4) Delete the sql folder so that other people can't access the SQL file directly

5) Test index.php to see if the user can log in (email: mchoi@village88.com, password: 123456)
